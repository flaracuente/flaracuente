- 👋 Hi, I’m Francis! And besides being a recruiter for PBM, Healthcare and STEM careers, I am also pursing my MBA in Information Systems.
- 👀 I’m interested in gaming (Sony fan-boy here, but I won't turn down any game invitation, regardless of the system).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL and Networking basics (first year of my MBA).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on sharing what might hopefully be your future career 😎. And also in building new databases and some day; systems integration.
